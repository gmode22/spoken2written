# Spoken To Written

This is a Python module which can that can convert a paragraph of spoken english to written english.

 For example, "two dollars" should be converted to $2. Abbreviations spoken as "C M" or "Triple A" should be written as "CM" and "AAA" respectively.

## Adding new rules:
1. We can define a structure for rules and save them in a file and retrive them when needed and we will add new rules as we discover.
2. By pipelining these rules we can check for rules in a paragraph one by one.

## Here are some possible future functionalities that  can be covered in the future versions of the module:

1. If the paragraph contains a money figure e.g. two million three thousand nine hundred and eighty-four then we may convert it to numbers as 2003984.

2. Handling of both American number system and Indian number system e.g. million, lakhs.

3. Handling of Dates e.g. Today's Date is twenty-eight October two thousand twenty as Today's Date is 28-10-2020/2020-10-28.

4. Handling of Punctuation.

5. Handling of proper spaces after one sentance.
